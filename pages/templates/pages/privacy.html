						        <p>It is Bolvex Capital's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://bolvexcapital.com">Bolvex Capital</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://bolvexcapital.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
								<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

											<h4 class="title text-left">Website Visitors</h4>
								<p>Like most website operators, Bolvex Capital collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bolvex Capital's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Bolvex Capital's visitors use its website. From time to time, Bolvex Capital may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
								<p>Bolvex Capital also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Bolvexcapital blog posts. Bolvex Capital only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

											<h4 class="title text-left">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
								<p>Certain visitors to Bolvex Capital's websites choose to interact with Bolvex Capital in ways that require Bolvex Capital to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Bolvex Capital gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at Bolvexcapital to provide a username and email address.</p>

											<h4 class="title text-left">Security</h4>
								<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

											<h4 class="title text-left">Advertisements</h4>
								<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
